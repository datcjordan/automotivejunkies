                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>The concept of Electrical Vehicle is not new, such ideas has been proven to be viable and even executed in the past. <br>
                        It often difficult to navigate or attributes the invention of Electric Car to a single inventor or even its origins. <br> 
                        But many has vouched that it was a series of continuous breakthroughs which shaped our modern understanding of <br>
                        Electric Cars. Some car enthusiasts may claim that Robert Anderson, a British inventor who was responsible for the <br>
                        initiation of EV origins, when he first developed a crude electric carriage, while your tech wiz neighbourhood Tesla fans 
                        attributes it to none other than history recognisable inventor, Nikola Tesla. <br>
                        Today’s frenzy of Electric Cars can be trace back to Elon Musk, the mastermind behind Tesla Cars, <br>
                        whom push the EV evolution into movement with Nikola original AC vehicle design (1882). More on that later.

                    <h1>WHY EV?</h1>
                    <p>As mentioned above the vendetta for Electric Vehicle has been further highlighted with the issues of sustainability, <br>
                            its capabilities on producing less emission pollutant and even potentially harness renewable energy input to produce 
                            movement has been constantly compare with traditional Internal Engine Combustion (IEC), which produce tons of <br>
                            Carbon Monoxide that harmful towards the general population and contributed to the rise of Global Warming scenario. 
                            That been EV aren’t free of unwanted pollution, as to some degree along the line of production; car frame build or its 
                            fuel system commonly “Lithium-Ions Battery” extraction and fabrication does produce questionable carbon footprints. 
                            Comparison in details of “Electric Vs Conventional Vehicle” regarding its footprint deserved another separate article, 
                            which our team will discuss in the future. <br>
                            This article is divided into several section, which includes a brief intro on our selected Top EV Brands and its models 
                            from recent years and sub section where we discuss on the technical comparison of each EV Brands/Model specification
                            ranging from price points, technology behind it, driving range, fuel efficiency, segmentation and top speeds.
